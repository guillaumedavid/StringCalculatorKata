This classic kata guides you step by step through the implementation of a calculator that receives a `String` as input.
It is a good exercise on refactoring and incremental implementation. It is also a good candidate for practising TDD.

## First step 

Create a function `add` that takes a `String` and returns a `String`:

    String add(String number)

>* The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers separated by comma, and returns their sum.
>* An empty string will return "0".
>* Example of inputs: `""`, `"1"`,`"1,2"`, `"1.1,2.2"`.
